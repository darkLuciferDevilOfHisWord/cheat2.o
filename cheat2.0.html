    <p class="card-text m-0">20.	Consider an application that is composed of one master process and multiple worker processes that are forked off the master at the start of application execution. All processes have access to  a pool of shared memory pages, and have permissions to read and write from it. This shared memory region (also called the request buffer) is used as follows: the master process receives incoming requests from clients over the network, and writes the requests into the shared request buffer. The worker processes must read the request from the request buffer, process it, and write the response back into the same region of the buffer. Once the response has been generated, the server must reply back to the client. The server and worker processes are single-threaded, and the server uses event-driven I/O to communicate over the network with the clients (you must not make these processes multi threaded). You may assume that the request and the response are of the same size, and multiple such requests or responses can be accommodated in the request buffer. You may also assume that processing every request takes similar amount of CPU time at the worker threads.
      Using this design idea as a starting point, describe the communication and synchronization mech- anisms that must be used between the server and worker processes, in order to let the server correctly delegate requests and obtain responses from the worker processes. Your design must ensure that every request placed in the request buffer is processed by one and only one worker thread. You must also ensure that the system is efficient (e.g., no request should be kept waiting if some worker is free) and fair (e.g., all workers share the load almost equally). While you can use any IPC mechanism of your choice, ensure that your system design is practical enough to be

       </p>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body p-2">
     Answer : <b>Several possible solutions exist. The main thing to keep in mind is that the server should be able to assign a certain request in the buffer to a worker, and the worker must be able to notify completion. For example, the master can use pipes or sockets or message queues with each worker. When it places a request in the shared memory, it can send the position of the request to one of the workers. Workers listen for this signal from the master, process the request, write the response, and send a message back to the master that it is done. The master monitors the pipes/sockets of all workers, and assigns the next request once the previous one is done.

When P1 is executing, a disk interrupt occurs, causing P1 to go to kernel mode to service that interrupt. The interrupt delivers all the disk blocks that unblock a process P2 (which blocked earlier on the disk read). The interrupt service routine has completed execution fully, and the OS is just about to re- turn back to the user mode of P1. At this point in time, what are the states (ready/running/blocked) of processes P1 and P2?

      int ret = fork();
      if(ret == 0) { do_child_task(); } else { do_parent_task1();
      do_parent_task2(); }
      
      With the way the code is written right now, the user has no control over the order in which the parent and child tasks execute, because the scheduling of the processes is done by the OS. Below are given two possible orderings of the tasks that the user wishes to enforce. For each part, briefly describe how you will modify the code given above to ensure the required ordering of tasks. You may write your answer in English or using pseudocode.
      Note that you cannot change the OS scheduling mechanism in any way to solve this question. If a process is scheduled by the OS before you want its task to execute, you must use mechanisms like system calls and IPC techniques available to you in userspace to delay the execution of the task till a suitable time.
      (a)	We want the parent to start execution of both its tasks only after the child process has finished its task and has terminated.
      (b)	We want the child process to execute its task after the parent process has finished its first task, but before it runs its second task. The parent must not execute its second task until the child has completed its task and has terminated.
       </p>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body p-2">
     Answer : <b>(a) Ans: Parent does wait() until child finishes, and then starts its tasks.
       (b) 
       Ans: Many solutions are possible. Parent and child share two pipes (or a socket). Parent writes to one pipe after completing task 1 and child blocks on this pipe read before starting its task. Child writes to pipe 2 after finishing its task, and parent blocks on this pipe read before starting its second task. (Or parent can use wait to block for child termination, like in previous part.)

Process C arrives at t = 8, and an initial CPU time of 3 units, after which it blocks to perform I/O for 3 time units. After returning

      (b) 
      Ans: A=10, B=23, C=12. A finishes at 10 units. Note that the arrival of shorter jobs B and C does not preempt A. Next, C finishes at 12. First task of B finishes at 15, B blocks from 15 to 18, and finally completes at 23 units.
      (c) 
      Ans: A=15, B=20, C=11. A runs until 6 units. Then the first task of B runs until 9 units. Note that the arrival of C does not preempt B because it has a shorter remaining time. C completes at 11. B is not ready yet, so A runs for another 4 units and completes at 15. Note that the completion of B’s I/O does not preempt A because A’s remaining time is shorter.
